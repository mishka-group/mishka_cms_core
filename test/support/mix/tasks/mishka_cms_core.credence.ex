defmodule Mix.Tasks.MishkaCmsCore.Credence do
  @shortdoc "Checks the code with Credence's pattern rules and fails on any finding"

  @moduledoc """
  Runs [Credence](https://hex.pm/packages/credence)'s pattern rules over `lib`, `test` and `config`
  and fails when one of them finds code that works but is written the slow or roundabout way
  (`length(list) == 0`, `Enum.map/2` into `Enum.sum/1`, a `@doc` on a `defp`, ...).

      mix mishka_cms_core.credence

  Credence ships no task that checks a whole project, so this one reads each file and calls
  `Credence.Pattern.analyze/2`, which works on the parsed source and compiles nothing. Credence's
  semantic round is left out: it compiles every file on its own, and `mix compile
  --warnings-as-errors` already fails on the compiler warnings it looks for.

  `mix ci` runs it after `credo`. It lives in `test/support`, beside the rest of the code that
  exists only to check this library, so Credence is never a dependency of a host;
  `cli/0` in `mix.exs` runs it in the test environment.

  ## Rules left out

    * `NoCaseTrueFalse` asks for `if`/`else` in place of `case expr do true -> ...; false -> ... end`.
      Mishka code matches on the boolean on purpose (pattern matching before `if`), so following the
      rule would turn the house style around.
